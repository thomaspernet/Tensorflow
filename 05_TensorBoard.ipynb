    "# Tensorboard Tutorial: Graph Visualization with Example \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is TensorBoard\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorboard is the interface used to visualize the graph and other tools\n",
    "to understand, debug, and optimize the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below comes from the graph you will generate in this tutorial.\n",
    "It is the main panel:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"image/image54_1.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the picture below, you can see the panel of Tensorboard. The panel\n",
    "contains different tabs, which are linked to the level of information\n",
    "you add when you run the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"image/image54_2.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Scalars: Show different useful information during the model training\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Graphs: Show the model\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Histogram: Display weights with a histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Distribution: Display the distribution of the weight\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Projector: Show Principal component analysis and T-SNE algorithm.\n",
    "    The technique uses for dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "During this tutorial, you will train a simple deep learning model. You\n",
    "will learn how it works in a future tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the graph, you can understand how the model work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Enqueue the data to the model: Push an amount of data equal to the\n",
    "    batch size to the model, i.e., Number of data feed after each\n",
    "    iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Feed the data to the Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Train the model\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Display the number of batches during the training. Save the model on\n",
    "    the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"image/image54_3.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind tensorboard is that neural network can be\n",
    "something known as a black box and we need a tool to inspect what’s\n",
    "inside this box. You can imagine tensorboard as a flashlight to start\n",
    "dive into the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps to understand the dependencies between operations, how the\n",
    "weights are computed, displays the loss function and much other useful\n",
    "information. When you bring all these pieces of information together,\n",
    "you have a great tool to debug and find how to improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you an idea of how useful the graph can be, look at the picture\n",
    "below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"image/image54_4.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network decides how to connect the different \"neurons\" and how\n",
    "many layers before the model can predict an outcome. Once you have\n",
    "defined the architecture, you not only need to train the model but also\n",
    "a metrics to compute the accuracy of the prediction. This metric is\n",
    "referred to as a **loss function.** The objective is to minimize the\n",
    "loss function. In different words, it means the model is making fewer\n",
    "errors. All machine learning algorithms will repeat many times the\n",
    "computations until the loss reach a flatter line. To minimize this loss\n",
    "function, you need to define a **learning rate.** It is the speed you\n",
    "want the model to learn. If you set a learning rate too high, the model\n",
    "does not have time to learn anything. This is the case in the left\n",
    "picture. The line is moving up and down, meaning the model predicts with\n",
    "pure guess the outcome. The picture on the right shows that the loss is\n",
    "decreasing over iteration until the curve got flatten, meaning the model\n",
    "found a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorBoard is a great tool to visualize such metrics and highlight\n",
    "potential issues. The neural network can take hours to weeks before they\n",
    "find a solution. TensorBoard updates the metrics very often. In this\n",
    "case, you don’t need to wait until the end to see if the model trains\n",
    "correctly. You can open TensorBoard check how the training is going and\n",
    "make the appropriate change if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to open TensorBoard from the\n",
    "terminal for MacOS and the Command line for Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code will be explained in a future tutorial, the focus here is on\n",
