    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural network, also known as *convnets*, is a well-known\n",
    "method in computer vision applications. This type of architecture is\n",
    "dominant to recognize objects from a picture or video.\n",

    "## The architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about Facebook a few years ago, after you uploaded a picture to\n",
    "your profile, you were asked to add a name to the face on the picture\n",
    "manually. Nowadays, Facebook uses convnet to tag your friend in the\n",
    "picture automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional neural network is not very difficult to understand. An\n",
    "input image is processed during the convolution phase and later\n",
    "attributed a label.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical convnet architecture can be summarized in the picture below.\n",
    "First of all, an image is pushed to the network; this is called the\n",
    "input image. Then, the input image goes through an infinite number of\n",
    "steps; this is the convolutional part of the network. Finally, the\n",
    "neural network can predict the digit on the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/thomaspernet/Tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/20_CNN_v7_files/image001.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "An image is composed of an array of pixels with height and width. A\n",
    "grayscale image has only one channel while the color image has three\n",
    "channels (each one for Red, Green, and Blue). A channel is stacked over\n",
    "each other. In this tutorial, you will use a grayscale image with only\n",
    "one channel. Each pixel has a value from 0 to 255 to reflect the\n",
    "intensity of the color. For instance, a pixel equals to 0 will show a\n",
    "white color while pixel with a value close to 255 will be darker.\n",

    "of the weights and improve its generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the convolutional part, the network keeps the essential features\n",
    "of the image and excludes irrelevant noise. For instance, the model is\n",
    "learning how to recognize an elephant from a picture with a mountain in\n",
    "the background. If you use a traditional neural network, the model will\n",
    "assign a weight to all the pixels, including those from the mountain\n",
    "which is not essential and can mislead the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, a convolutional neural network will use a mathematical\n",
    "technique to extract only the most relevant pixels. This mathematical\n",
    "operation is called convolution. This technique allows the network to\n",
    "learn increasingly complex features at each layer. The convolution\n",
    "divides the matrix into small pieces to learn to most essential elements\n",

    "element-wise multiplication is called a feature map. This step is\n",
