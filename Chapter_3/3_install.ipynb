    "\n",
    "## TensorFlow Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow supports computations across multiple CPUs and GPUs. It means\n",
    "that the computations can be distributed across devices to improve the\n",
    "speed of the training. With parallelization, you don't need to wait for\n",
    "weeks to obtain the results of training algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows user, TensorFlow provides two versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **TensorFlow with CPU support only**: If your Machine does not run\n",
    "    on NVIDIA GPU, you can only install this version\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **TensorFlow with GPU support**: For faster computation, you can use\n",
