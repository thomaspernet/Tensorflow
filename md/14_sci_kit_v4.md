# What is Scikit-learn?


Scikit-learn is an open source Python library for machine learning. The
library supports state-of-the-art algorithms such as KNN, XGBoost,
random forest, SVM among others. It is built on top of Numpy.
Scikit-learn is widely used in kaggle competition as well as prominent
tech companies. Scikit-learn helps in preprocessing, dimensionality
reduction(parameter selection), classification, regression, clustering,
and model selection.

Scikit-learn has the best documentation of all opensource libraries. It
provides you an interactive chart at
<http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html>.

Scikit-learn is not very difficult to use and provides excellent
results. However, scikit learn does not support parallel computations.
It is possible to run a deep learning algorithm with it but is not an
optimal solution, especially if you know how to use TensorFlow.

In this tutorial, you will learn.

## Download and Install scikit-learn


**Option 1:** AWS

scikit-learn can be used over AWS. Please refer to the part on AWS. The docker
image has scikit-learn preinstalled.

To use developer version use the command in Jupyter


```python
import sys

!{sys.executable} -m pip install git+git://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
```

**Option 2:** Mac or Windows using Anaconda

Recently, the developers of scikit have released a development version
that tackles common problem faced with the current version. We found it
more convenient to use the developer version instead of the current
version.

If you installed scikit-learn with the conda environment, please follow
the step to update to version 0.20

**Step 1:** Activate tensorflow environment


```python
source activate hello-tf
```

**Step 2:** Remove scikit lean using the conda command


```python
conda remove scikit-learn
```

**Step 3)** Install scikit learn developer version along with necessary libraries.


```python
conda install -c anaconda git
pip install Cython
pip install h5py
pip install git+git://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
```

Note: Windows used will need to install Microsoft Visual C++ 14. You can get it from here

This part is divided into two parts:

1.  Machine learning with scikit-learn

2.  How to trust your model with LIME

The first part details how to build a pipeline, create a model and tune
the hyperparameters while the second part provides state-of-the-art in
term of model selection.

## Step 1: Import the data

During this tutorial, you will be using the `adult` dataset. For a
background in this dataset refer If you are interested to know more
about the descriptive statistics, please use Dive and Overview tools.
Refer this tutorial learn more about Dive and Overview

You import the dataset with Pandas. Note that you need to convert the
type of the continuous variables in float format.

This dataset includes eights categorical variables:

The categorical variables are listed in `CATE_FEATURES`

-   workclass

-   education

-   marital

-   occupation

-   relationship

-   race

-   sex

-   native_country

moreover, six continuous variables:

The continuous variables are listed in `CONTI_FEATURES`

-   age

-   fnlwgt

-   education_num

-   capital_gain

-   capital_loss

-   hours_week

Note that we fill the list by hand so that you have a better idea of
what columns we are using. A faster way to construct a list of
categorical or continuous is to use:

```
## List Categorical
CATE_FEATURES = df_train.iloc[:,:-1].select_dtypes('object').columns
print(CATE_FEATURES)
## List continuous
CONTI_FEATURES =  df_train._get_numeric_data()
print(CONTI_FEATURES)
```

Here is the code to import the data: 



```python
# Import dataset
import pandas as pd

## Define path data
COLUMNS = ['age','workclass', 'fnlwgt', 'education', 'education_num', 'marital',
           'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'capital_gain', 'capital_loss',
           'hours_week', 'native_country', 'label']
### Define continuous list
CONTI_FEATURES  = ['age', 'fnlwgt','capital_gain', 'education_num', 'capital_loss', 'hours_week']
### Define categorical list
CATE_FEATURES = ['workclass', 'education', 'marital', 'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'native_country']

## Prepare the data
features = ['age','workclass', 'fnlwgt', 'education', 'education_num', 'marital',
           'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'capital_gain', 'capital_loss',
           'hours_week', 'native_country']

PATH = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data"

df_train = pd.read_csv(PATH, skipinitialspace=True, names = COLUMNS, index_col=False)
df_train[CONTI_FEATURES] =df_train[CONTI_FEATURES].astype('float64')
df_train.describe()
```

You can check the count of unique values of the `native_country`
features. You can see that only one household comes from
`Holand-Netherlands`. This household won't bring us any information, but
will through an error during the training.

    Holand-Netherlands                1
    Name: native_country, dtype: int64



You can exclude this uninformative row from the dataset


```python
## Drop Netherland, because only one row
df_train = df_train[df_train.native_country != "Holand-Netherlands"]
```

Next, you store the position of the continuous features in a list. You
will need it in the next step to build the pipeline.

The code below will loop over all columns names in `CONTI_FEATURES` and
get its location (i.e., its number) and then append it to a list called
`conti_features`


```python
## Get the column index of the categorical features
conti_features = []
for i in CONTI_FEATURES:
    position = df_train.columns.get_loc(i)
    conti_features.append(position)
print(conti_features)  

```

    [0, 2, 10, 4, 11, 12]


The code below does the same job as above but for the categorical
variable. The code below repeats what you have done previously, except
with the categorical features.


```python
## Get the column index of the categorical features
categorical_features = []
for i in CATE_FEATURES:
    position = df_train.columns.get_loc(i)
    categorical_features.append(position)
print(categorical_features)  
```

    [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13]


You can have a look at the dataset. Note that, each categorical feature
is a string. You cannot feed a model with a string value. You need to
transform the dataset using a dummy variable.


```python
df_train.head(5)
```

In fact, you need to create one column for each group in the feature.
First, you can run the code below to compute the total amount of columns
needed.


```python
print(df_train[CATE_FEATURES].nunique(),
      'There are',sum(df_train[CATE_FEATURES].nunique()), 'groups in the whole dataset')

```

    workclass          9
    education         16
    marital            7
    occupation        15
    relationship       6
    race               5
    sex                2
    native_country    41
    dtype: int64 There are 101 groups in the whole dataset


The whole dataset contains 101 groups as shown above. For instance, the
features `of ``workclass` have nine groups. You can visualize the name
of the groups with the following codes

`unique()` returns the unique values of the categorical features.


```python
for i in CATE_FEATURES:
    print(df_train[i].unique())
```

    ['State-gov' 'Self-emp-not-inc' 'Private' 'Federal-gov' 'Local-gov' '?'
     'Self-emp-inc' 'Without-pay' 'Never-worked']
    ['Bachelors' 'HS-grad' '11th' 'Masters' '9th' 'Some-college' 'Assoc-acdm'
     'Assoc-voc' '7th-8th' 'Doctorate' 'Prof-school' '5th-6th' '10th'
     '1st-4th' 'Preschool' '12th']
    ['Never-married' 'Married-civ-spouse' 'Divorced' 'Married-spouse-absent'
     'Separated' 'Married-AF-spouse' 'Widowed']
    ['Adm-clerical' 'Exec-managerial' 'Handlers-cleaners' 'Prof-specialty'
     'Other-service' 'Sales' 'Craft-repair' 'Transport-moving'
     'Farming-fishing' 'Machine-op-inspct' 'Tech-support' '?'
     'Protective-serv' 'Armed-Forces' 'Priv-house-serv']
    ['Not-in-family' 'Husband' 'Wife' 'Own-child' 'Unmarried' 'Other-relative']
    ['White' 'Black' 'Asian-Pac-Islander' 'Amer-Indian-Eskimo' 'Other']
    ['Male' 'Female']
    ['United-States' 'Cuba' 'Jamaica' 'India' '?' 'Mexico' 'South'
     'Puerto-Rico' 'Honduras' 'England' 'Canada' 'Germany' 'Iran'
     'Philippines' 'Italy' 'Poland' 'Columbia' 'Cambodia' 'Thailand' 'Ecuador'
     'Laos' 'Taiwan' 'Haiti' 'Portugal' 'Dominican-Republic' 'El-Salvador'
     'France' 'Guatemala' 'China' 'Japan' 'Yugoslavia' 'Peru'
     'Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc)' 'Scotland' 'Trinadad&Tobago' 'Greece'
     'Nicaragua' 'Vietnam' 'Hong' 'Ireland' 'Hungary']


Therefore, the training dataset will contain 101 + 7 columns. The last
seven columns are the continuous features.

Scikit-learn can take care of the conversion. It is done in two steps:

-   First, you need to convert the string to ID. For instance,
    `State-gov` will have the ID 1, `Self-emp-not-inc` ID 2 and so on.
    The function `LabelEncoder` does this for you

-   Transpose each ID into a new column. As mentioned before, the
    dataset has 101 group's ID. Therefore there will be 101 columns
    capturing all categoricals features' groups. Scikit-learn has a
    function called `OneHotEncoder` that performs this operation

## Step 2: Create the train/test set


Now that the dataset is ready, we can split it 80/20. 80 percent for the
training set and 20 percent for the test set.

You can use `train_test_split`. The first argument is the dataframe is
the features and the second argument is the label dataframe. You can
specify the size of the test set with `test_size`.


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df_train[features],
                                                    df_train.label,
                                                    test_size = 0.2,
                                                    random_state=0)

X_train.head(5)
print(X_train.shape, X_test.shape)

```

    (26048, 14) (6512, 14)


## Step 3: Build the pipeline


The pipeline makes it easier to feed the model with consistent data. The
idea behind is to put the raw data into a 'pipeline' to perform
operations. For instance, with the current dataset, you need to
standardize the continuous variables and convert the categorical data.
Note that you can perform any operation inside the pipeline. For
instance, if you have 'NA's' in the dataset, you can replace them by the
mean or median. You can also create new variables.

You have the choice; hard code the two processes or create a pipeline.
The first choice can lead to data leakage and create inconsistencies
over time. A better option is to use the pipeline.


```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer, make_column_transformer
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
```

The pipeline will perform two operations before feeding the logistic
classifier:

1.  Standardize the variable: `StandardScaler()``

2.  Convert the categorical features: `OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)`

You can perform the two steps using the `make_column_transformer`. This
function is not available in the current version of scikit-learn (0.19).
It is not possible with the current version to perform the label encoder
and one hot encoder in the pipeline. It is one reason we decided to use
the developer version.

`make_column_transformer` is easy to use. You need to define which
columns to apply the transformation and what transformation to operate.
For instance, to standardize the continuous feature, you can do:

-   `conti_features, StandardScaler()` inside `make_column_transformer`.

-   `conti_features`: list with the continuous variable

-   `StandardScaler`: standardize the variable

The object `OneHotEncoder` inside `make_column_transformer`
automatically encodes the label.


```python
preprocess = make_column_transformer(
    (conti_features, StandardScaler()),
    ### Need to be numeric not string to specify columns name 
    (categorical_features, OneHotEncoder(sparse=False))
)
```

You can test if the pipeline works with `fit_transform`. The dataset
should have the following shape: 26048, 107


```python
preprocess.fit_transform(X_train).shape

```




    (26048, 107)



The data transformer is ready to use. You can create the pipeline with
`make_pipeline`. Once the data are transformed, you can feed the
logistic regression.


```python
model = make_pipeline(
    preprocess,
    LogisticRegression())
```

Training a model with scikit-learn is trivial. You need to use the
object `fit` preceded by the pipeline, i.e., `model`. You can print the
accuracy with the `score` object from the scikit-learn library


```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("logistic regression score: %f" % model.score(X_test, y_test))

```

    logistic regression score: 0.850891


Finally, you can predict the classes with `predict_proba`. It returns
the probability for each class. Note that it sums to one.


```python
model.predict_proba(X_test)

```




    array([[0.83576282, 0.16423718],
           [0.94582346, 0.05417654],
           [0.64758444, 0.35241556],
           ...,
           [0.99639221, 0.00360779],
           [0.02072329, 0.97927671],
           [0.56782129, 0.43217871]])



## Step 4: Using our pipeline in a grid search


Tune the hyperparameter (variables that determine network structure like
hidden units) can be tedious and exhausting. One way to evaluate the
model could be to change the size of the training set and evaluate the
performances. You can repeat this method ten times to see the score
metrics. However, it is too much work.

Instead, scikit-learn provides a function to carry out parameter tuning
and cross-validation.

**Cross-validation**

Cross-Validation means during the training, the training set is slip `n`
number of times in folds and then evaluates the model `n` time. For
instance, if `cv` is set to 10, the training set is trained and
evaluates ten times. At each round, the classifier chooses randomly nine
fold to train the model, and the 10th fold is meant for evaluation.

**Grid search** Each classifier has hyperparameters to tune. You can try
different values, or you can set a parameter grid. If you go to the
scikit-learn official website, you can see the logistic classifier has
different parameters to tune. To make the training faster, you choose to
tune the `C` parameter. It controls for the regularization parameter. It
should be positive. A small value gives more weight to the regularizer.

You can use the object `GridSearchCV`. You need to create a dictionary
containing the hyperparameters to tune.

You list the hyperparameters followed by the values you want to try. For
instance, to tune the `C` parameter, you use:

-   `'logisticregression__C': [0.1, 1.0, 1.0]`: The parameter is
    preceded by the name, in lower case, of the classifier and two
    underscores.

The model will try four different values: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.

You train the model using 10 folds: `cv=10`


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Construct the parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'logisticregression__C': [0.001, 0.01,0.1, 1.0],
    }
```

You can train the model using `GridSearchCV` with the parameter gri and
cv.


```python
# Train the model
grid_clf = GridSearchCV(model,
                        param_grid,
                        cv=10,
                        iid=False)
grid_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```




    GridSearchCV(cv=10, error_score='raise-deprecating',
           estimator=Pipeline(memory=None,
         steps=[('columntransformer', ColumnTransformer(n_jobs=None, remainder='drop', sparse_threshold=0.3,
             transformer_weights=None,
             transformers=[('standardscaler', StandardScaler(copy=True, with_mean=True, with_std=True), [0, 2, 10, 4, 11, 12]), ('onehotencoder', OneHotEncoder(categoric...ty='l2', random_state=None, solver='liblinear',
              tol=0.0001, verbose=0, warm_start=False))]),
           fit_params=None, iid=False, n_jobs=None,
           param_grid={'logisticregression__C': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0]},
           pre_dispatch='2*n_jobs', refit=True, return_train_score='warn',
           scoring=None, verbose=0)



To access the best parameters, you use `best_params_`


```python
grid_clf.best_params_
```




    {'logisticregression__C': 1.0}



After trained the model with four differents regularization values, the
optimal parameter is


```python
print("best logistic regression from grid search: %f" % grid_clf.best_estimator_.score(X_test, y_test))

```

    best logistic regression from grid search: 0.850891


To access the predicted probabilities:


```python
grid_clf.best_estimator_.predict_proba(X_test)

```




    array([[0.83576282, 0.16423718],
           [0.94582346, 0.05417654],
           [0.64758444, 0.35241556],
           ...,
           [0.99639221, 0.00360779],
           [0.02072329, 0.97927671],
           [0.56782129, 0.43217871]])



## Create XGBoost


Let's try to train one of the best classifiers on the market. XGBoost is
an improvement over the random forest. The theoretical background of the
classifier out of the scope of this tutorial. Keep in mind that, XGBoost
has won lots of kaggle competitions. With an average dataset size, it
can perform as good as a deep learning algorithm or even better.

The classifier is challenging to train because it has a high number of
parameters to tune. You can, of course, use `GridSearchCV` to choose the
parameter for you.

Instead, let's see how to use a better way to find the optimal
parameters. `GridSearchCV` can be tedious and very long to train if you
pass many values. The search space grows along with the number of
parameters. A preferable solution is to use `RandomizedSearchCV`. This
method consists of choosing the values of each hyperparameter after each
iteration randomly. For instance, if the classifier is trained over 1000
iterations, then 1000 combinations are evaluated. It works more or less
like. `GridSearchCV`

You need to import `xgboost`. If the library is not installed, please
use `pip3 install xgboost` or 


```
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m conda install xgboost
```

In Jupyter environment


```python
import xgboost
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
```

The next step includes specifying the parameters to tune. You can refer
to the official documentation to see all the parameters to tune. For the
sake of the tutorial, you only choose two hyperparameters with two
values each. XGBoost takes lots of time to train, the more
hyperparameters in the grid, the longer time you need to wait.


```python
params = {
        'xgbclassifier__gamma': [0.5, 1],
        'xgbclassifier__max_depth': [3, 4]
        }
```

You construct a new pipeline with XGBoost classifier. You choose to
define 600 estimators. Note that `n_estimators` are a parameter that you
can tune. A high value can lead to overfitting. You can try by yourself
different values but be aware it can takes hours. You use the default
value for the other parameters


```python
model_xgb = make_pipeline(
    preprocess,
    xgboost.XGBClassifier(
                          n_estimators=600,
                          objective='binary:logistic',
                          silent=True,
                          nthread=1)
)
```

You can improve the cross-validation with the Stratified K-Folds
cross-validator. You construct only three folds here to faster the
computation but lowering the quality. Increase this value to 5 or 10 at
home to improve the results.

You choose to train the model over four iterations.


```python
skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=3,
                      shuffle = True,
                      random_state = 1001)

random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(model_xgb,
                                   param_distributions=params,
                                   n_iter=4,
                                   scoring='accuracy',
                                   n_jobs=4,
                                   cv=skf.split(X_train, y_train),
                                   verbose=3,
                                   random_state=1001)
```

The randomized search is ready to use, you can train the model


```python
#grid_xgb = GridSearchCV(model_xgb, params, cv=10, iid=False)
random_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

```

    Fitting 3 folds for each of 4 candidates, totalling 12 fits

    RandomizedSearchCV(cv=<generator object _BaseKFold.split at 0x10dddabf8>,
              error_score='raise-deprecating',
              estimator=Pipeline(memory=None,
         steps=[('columntransformer', ColumnTransformer(n_jobs=None, remainder='drop', sparse_threshold=0.3,
             transformer_weights=None,
             transformers=[('standardscaler', StandardScaler(copy=True, with_mean=True, with_std=True), [0, 2, 10, 4, 11, 12]), ('onehotencoder', OneHotEncoder(categoric...
           reg_alpha=0, reg_lambda=1, scale_pos_weight=1, seed=None,
           silent=True, subsample=1))]),
              fit_params=None, iid='warn', n_iter=4, n_jobs=4,
              param_distributions={'xgbclassifier__gamma': [0.5, 1], 'xgbclassifier__max_depth': [3, 4]},
              pre_dispatch='2*n_jobs', random_state=1001, refit=True,
              return_train_score='warn', scoring='accuracy', verbose=3)



As you can see, XGBoost has a better score than the previous logisitc
regression.


```python
print("Best parameter", random_search.best_params_)
print("best logistic regression from grid search: %f" % random_search.best_estimator_.score(X_test, y_test))
```

    Best parameter {'xgbclassifier__max_depth': 3, 'xgbclassifier__gamma': 0.5}
    best logistic regression from grid search: 0.873157



```python
random_search.best_estimator_.predict(X_test)
```




    array(['<=50K', '<=50K', '<=50K', ..., '<=50K', '>50K', '<=50K'],
          dtype=object)



## Create DNN - `MLPClassifier`


Finally, you can train a deep learning algorithm with scikit-learn. The
method is the same as the other classifier. The classifier is available
at `MLPClassifier`.


```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
```

You define the following deep learning algorithm:

-   Adam solver

-   Relu activation function

-   Alpha = 0.0001

-   batch size of 150

-   Two hidden layers with 100 and 50 neurons respectively


```python
model_dnn = make_pipeline(
    preprocess,
    MLPClassifier(solver='adam',
                  alpha=0.0001,
                  activation='relu',
                    batch_size=150,
                    hidden_layer_sizes=(200, 100),
                    random_state=1))
```

You can change the number of layers to improve the model


```python
model_dnn.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("DNN regression score: %f" % model_dnn.score(X_test, y_test))
```

    DNN regression score: 0.820485


    /Users/Thomas/anaconda3/envs/hello-tf/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/neural_network/multilayer_perceptron.py:562: ConvergenceWarning: Stochastic Optimizer: Maximum iterations (200) reached and the optimization hasn't converged yet.
      % self.max_iter, ConvergenceWarning)


## LIME


Now that you have a good model, you need a tool to trust it. Machine
learning algorithm, especially random forest and neural network, are
known to be blax-box algorithm. Say differently, it works but no one
knows why.

Three researchers have come up with a great tool to see how the computer
makes a prediction. The paper is called `Why Should I Trust You?`

They developed an algorithm named **Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic
Explanations (LIME)**.

Take an example:

sometimes you do not know if you can trust a machine-learning
prediction:

A doctor, for example, cannot trust a diagnosis just because a computer
said so. You also need to know if you can trust the model before putting
it into production.

Imagine we can understand why any classifier is making a prediction even
incredibly complicated models such as neural networks, random forests or
svms with any kernel

will become more accessible to trust a prediction if we can understand
the reasons behind it. From the example with the doctor, if the model
told him which symptoms are essential you would trust it, it is also
easier to figure out if you should not trust the model.

Lime can tell you what features affect the decisions of the classifier

#### Data Preparation

They are a couple of things you need to change to run LIME with python.
First of all, you need to install lime in the terminal. You can use
`pip install lime`

Lime makes use of `LimeTabularExplainer` object to approximate the model
locally. This object requires:

-   a dataset in numpy format

-   The name of the features: `feature_names`

-   The name of the classes: `class_names`

-   The index of the column of the categorical features:
    `categorical_features`

-   The name of the group for each categorical features:
    `categorical_names`

**Create numpy train set**

You can copy and convert `df_train` from pandas to numpy very easily


```python
df_train.head(5)
# Create numpy data
df_lime = df_train
df_lime.head(3)
```

</div>



**Get the class name** The label is accessible with the object
`unique()`. You should see:

-   '&lt;=50K'

-   '&gt;50K'


```python
# Get the class name
class_names = df_lime.label.unique()
class_names

array(['<=50K', '>50K'], dtype=object)
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

          3 class_names
          4 
    ----> 5 array(['<=50K', '>50K'], dtype=object)


    NameError: name 'array' is not defined


**index of the column of the categorical features**

You can use the method you lean before to get the name of the group. You
encode the label with `LabelEncoder`. You repeat the operation on all
the categorical features.


```python
## 
import sklearn.preprocessing as preprocessing
categorical_names = {}
for feature in CATE_FEATURES:
    le = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()
    le.fit(df_lime[feature])
    df_lime[feature] = le.transform(df_lime[feature])
    categorical_names[feature] = le.classes_
print(categorical_names)    
```

Now that the dataset is ready, you can construct the different dataset.
You actually transform the data outside of the pipeline in order to
avoid errors with LIME. The training set in the `LimeTabularExplainer`
should be a numpy array without string. With the method above, you have
a training dataset already converted.


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train_lime, X_test_lime, y_train_lime, y_test_lime = train_test_split(df_lime[features],
                                                    df_lime.label,
                                                    test_size = 0.2,
                                                    random_state=0)

X_train_lime.head(5)
```

You can make the pipeline with the optimal parameters from XGBoost


```python
model_xgb = make_pipeline(
    preprocess,
    xgboost.XGBClassifier(max_depth = 3,
                          gamma = 0.5,
                          n_estimators=600,
                          objective='binary:logistic',
                          silent=True,
                          nthread=1))

model_xgb.fit(X_train_lime, y_train_lime)

```

You get a warning. The warning explains that you do not need to create a
label encoder before the pipeline. If you do not want to use LIME, you
are fine to use the method from the first part of the tutorial.
Otherwise, you can keep with this method, first create an encoded
dataset, set get the hot one encoder within the pipeline.


```python
print("best logistic regression from grid search: %f" % model_xgb.score(X_test_lime, y_test_lime))

best logistic regression from grid search: 0.873157

model_xgb.predict_proba(X_test_lime)

```

Before to use LIME in action, let's create a numpy array with the
features of the wrong classification. You can use that list later to get
an idea about what mislead the classifier.


```python
temp = pd.concat([X_test_lime, y_test_lime], axis= 1)
temp['predicted'] = model_xgb.predict(X_test_lime)
temp['wrong']=  temp['label'] != temp['predicted']
temp = temp.query('wrong==True').drop('wrong', axis=1)

temp= temp.sort_values(by=['label'])
temp.shape

```

You create a lambda function to retrieve the prediction from the model
with the new data. You will need it soon.


```python
predict_fn = lambda x: model_xgb.predict_proba(x).astype(float)

```

You convert the pandas dataframe to numpy array


```python
X_train_lime = X_train_lime.values
X_test_lime = X_test_lime.values

X_test_lime

model_xgb.predict_proba(X_test_lime)


print(features,
      class_names,
      categorical_features,
      categorical_names)
```

Finally, you create the `LimeTabularExplainer`.


```python
import lime
import lime.lime_tabular
### Train should be label encoded not one hot encoded
explainer = lime.lime_tabular.LimeTabularExplainer(X_train_lime ,
                                                   feature_names = features,
                                                   class_names=class_names,
                                                   categorical_features=categorical_features, 
                                                   categorical_names=categorical_names,
                                                   kernel_width=3)
```

Lets choose a random household from the test set and see the model
prediction and how the computer made his choice.


```python
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(1)
i = 100
print(y_test_lime.iloc[i])

X_test_lime[i]
```

You can use the `explainer` with `explain_instance` to check the
explanation behind the model


```python
exp = explainer.explain_instance(X_test_lime[i], predict_fn, num_features=6)
exp.show_in_notebook(show_all=False)
```

We can see that the classifier predicted the household correctly. The
income is, indeed, above 50k.

The first thing we can say is the classifier is not that sure about the
predicted probabilities. The machine predicts the household has an
income over 50k with a probability of 64%. This 64% is made up of
`Capital gain` and `marital`. The blue color contributes negatively to
the positive class and the orange line, positively.

The classifier is confused because the capital gain of this household is
null, while the capital gain is usually a good predictor of wealth.
Besides, the household works less than 40 hours per week. Age,
occupation, and sex contribute positively to the classifier.

If the marital status were single, the classifier would have predicted
an income below 50k (0.64-0.18 = 0.46)

We can try with another household which has been wrongly classified


```python
temp.head(3)

temp.iloc[1,:-2]
i = 1
print('This observation is', temp.iloc[i,-2:])

exp = explainer.explain_instance(temp.iloc[1,:-2], predict_fn, num_features=6)
exp.show_in_notebook(show_all=False)
```

![](https://github.com/thomaspernet/Tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/14_sci_kit_v4_files/image003.png)  

The classifier predicted an income below 50k while it is untrue. This
household seems odd. It does not have a capital gain, nor capital loss.
He is divorced and is 60 years old, and it is an educated people, i.e.,
`education_num` &gt; 12. According to the overall pattern, this
household should, like explain by the classifier, get an income below
50k.

You try to play around with LIME. You will notice gross mistakes from
the classifier.

You can check the GitHub of the owner of the library. They provide extra
documentation for image and text classification.
