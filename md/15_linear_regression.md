# Linear Regression with TensorFlow  

## Linear regression

In this part, you will learn basic principles of linear regression
and machine learning in general.

TensorFlow provides tools to have full control of the computations. This
is done with the low-level API. On top of that, TensorFlow is equipped
with a vast array of APIs to perform many machine learning algorithms.
This is the high-level API. TensorFlow calls them estimators

-   Low-level API: Build the architecture, optimization of the model
    from scratch. It is complicated for a beginner

-   High-level API: Define the algorithm. It is easer-friendly.
    TensorFlow provides a toolbox calls **estimator** to construct,
    train, evaluate and make a prediction.

In this tutorial, you will use the **estimators only**. The computations
are faster and are easier to implement. The first part of the tutorial
explains how to use the gradient descent optimizer to train a linear
regression. In a second part, you will use the Boston dataset to predict
the price of a house using TensorFlow estimator.

## How to train a linear regression model

Before we begin to train the model, let’s have look at what is a linear
regression.

Imagine you have two variables, $x$ and $y$ and your task is to predict
the value of $y$ knowing the value of $x$. If you plot the data, you can
see a positive relationship between your independent variable, $x$ and
your dependent variable $y$.

![](https://github.com/thomaspernet/Tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/15_linear-regression_files/image58.png)

You may observe, if $x = 1$, $y$ will roughly be equal to 6 and if
$x = 2$, $y$ will be around 8.5.

This is not a very accurate method and prone to error, especially with a
dataset with hundreds of thousands of points.

A linear regression is evaluated with an equation. The variable $y$ is
explained by one or many covariates. In your example, there is only one
dependent variable. If you have to write this equation, it will be:

$$y = \beta + \alpha X + \epsilon$$

With:

-   $\beta$ is the bias. i.e. if $x = 0$, $y = \beta$

-   $\alpha$ is the weight associated to $x$

-   $\epsilon$ is the residual or the error of the model. It includes
    what the model cannot learn from the data

Imagine you fit the model and you find the following solution for:

-   $\beta = 3.8$

-   $\alpha = 2.78$

You can substitute those numbers in the equation and it becomes:

$$y = 3.8 + 2.78x$$

You have now a better way to find the values for $y$. That is, you can
replace $x$ with any value you want to predict $y$. In the image below,
we have replace $x$ in the equation with all the values in the dataset
and plot the result.

![](https://github.com/thomaspernet/Tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/15_linear-regression_files/image59.png)

The red line represents the fitted value, that is the values of $y$ for
each value of $x$. You don’t need to see the value of $x$ to predict
$y$, for each $x$ there is an$y$ which belongs to the red line. You can
also predict for values of $x$ higher than 2!

If you want to extend the linear regression to more covariates, you can
by adding more variables to the model. The difference between
traditional analysis and linear regression is the linear regression
looks at how $y$ will react for each variable $X$ taken independently.

Let’s see an example. Imagine you want to predict the sales of an ice
cream shop. The dataset contains different information such as the
weather (i.e rainy, sunny, cloudy), customer informations (i.e salary,
gender, marital status).

Traditional analysis will try to predict the sale by let’s say computing
the average for each variable and try to estimate the sale for different
scenarios. It will lead to poor predictions and restrict the analysis to
the chosen scenario.

If you use linear regression, you can write this equation:

$$Sales  = \beta + \alpha_{1}X + \epsilon$$

The algorithm will find the best solution for the weights; it means it
will try to minimize the cost (the difference between the fitted line
and the data points).

**How the algorithm works**

![](https://github.com/thomaspernet/Tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/15_linear-regression_files/image59_1.png)

The algorithm will choose a random number for each $\beta$ and $\alpha$
and replace the value of $x$ to get the predicted value of $y$. If the
dataset has 100 observations, the algorithm computes 100 predicted
values.

We can compute the error, noted $\epsilon,\ $ of the model, which is the
difference between the predicted value and the real value. A positive
error means the model underestimates the prediction of y, and a negative
error means the model overestimates the prediction of y.

$$\epsilon = y - ypred$$

Your goal is to minimize the square of the error. The algorithm computes
the mean of the square error. This step is called minimization of the
error. For linear regression is the **Mean Square Error**, also called
MSE. Mathematically, it is:

$$MSE(X) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^{m}(\theta^{T}x^{i} - y^{i})^{2}$$

Where:

-   $\theta^{T}\ $is the weights so $\theta^{T}x^{i}\ $refers to the
    predicted value

-   y is the real values

-   m is the number of observations

Note that $\theta^{T}$ means it uses the transpose of the matrices. The
$\frac{1}{m}\sum$ is the mathematical notation of the mean.

The goal is to find the best $\theta$ that minimize the MSE

If the average error is large, it means the model performs poorly and
the weights are not chosen properly. To correct the weights, you need to
use an optimizer. The traditional optimizer is called **Gradient Descent**.

The gradient descent takes the derivative and decreases or increases the
weight. If the derivative is positive, the weight is decreased. If the
derivative is negative, the weight increases. The model will update the
weights and recompute the error. This process is repeated until the
error does not change anymore. Each process is called an **iteration**.
Besides, the gradients are multiplied by a learning rate. It indicates
the speed of the learning.

If the learning rate is too small, it will take very long time for the
algorithm to converge (i.e requires lots of iterations). If the learning
rate is too high, the algorithm might never converge.

![](https://github.com/thomaspernet/Tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/15_linear-regression_files/image60.png)

You can see from the picture above, the model repeats the process about
20 times before to find a stable value for the weights, therefore
reaching the lowest error.

**Note that**, the error is not equal to zero but stabilizes around 5.
It means, the model makes a typical error of 5. If you want to reduce
the error, you need to add more information to the model such as more
variables or use different estimators.

You remember the first equation

$$y = \beta + \alpha X + \epsilon$$

The final weights are 3.8 and 2.78. The video below shows you how the
gradient descent optimize the loss function to find this weights

## How to train a Linear Regression with TensorFlow

Now that you have a better understanding of what is happening behind the
hood, you are ready to use the `estimator` API provided by TensorFlow to
train your first linear regression.

You will use the Boston Dataset, which includes the following variables

| crim    | per capita crime rate by town                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| zn      | proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. |
| indus   | proportion of non-retail business acres per town.            |
| nox     | nitric oxides concentration                                  |
| rm      | average number of rooms per dwelling                         |
| age     | proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940       |
| dis     | weighted distances to five Boston employment centres         |
| tax     | full-value property-tax rate per  dollars 10,000             |
| ptratio | pupil-teacher ratio by town                                  |
| medv    | Median value of owner-occupied homes in thousand dollars     |

You will use three different datasets:

| dataset    | objective                                            | shape   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Training   | Train the model and obtain the weights               | 400, 10 |
| Evaluation | Evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data | 100, 10 |
| Predict    | Use the model to predict house value on new data     | 6, 10   |

The objectives is to use the features of the dataset to predict the
value of the house.

During the second part of the tutorial, you will learn how to use
TensorFlow with three different way to import the data:

-   With Pandas

-   With Numpy

-   Only TF

Note that, all options **provide the same results.**

You will learn how to use the high-level API to build, train an evaluate
a linear regression model. If you were using the low-level API, you had
to define by hand the:

-   Loss function

-   Optimize: Gradient descent

-   Matrices multiplication

-   Graph and tensor

This is tedious and more complicated for beginner.

### Pandas


You need to import the necessary libraries to train the model.


```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets
import tensorflow as tf
import itertools
```

    /Users/Thomas/anaconda3/envs/hello-tf/lib/python3.6/importlib/_bootstrap.py:219: RuntimeWarning: compiletime version 3.5 of module 'tensorflow.python.framework.fast_tensor_util' does not match runtime version 3.6
      return f(*args, **kwds)


**Step 1:** Import the data with panda.

You define the column names and store it in `COLUMNS`. You can use
`pd.read_csv()` to import the data.


```python
COLUMNS = ["crim", "zn", "indus", "nox", "rm", "age",

"dis", "tax", "ptratio", "medv"]

training_set = pd.read_csv("/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/Learning/Upwork/tuto_TF/data/boston_train.csv", skipinitialspace=True,skiprows=1, names=COLUMNS)

test_set = pd.read_csv("/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/Learning/Upwork/tuto_TF/data/boston_test.csv", skipinitialspace=True,skiprows=1, names=COLUMNS)

prediction_set = pd.read_csv("/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/Learning/Upwork/tuto_TF/data/boston_predict.csv", skipinitialspace=True,skiprows=1, names=COLUMNS)


```

You can print the shape of the data.


```python
print(training_set.shape, test_set.shape, prediction_set.shape)


```

    (400, 10) (100, 10) (6, 10)


Note that the label, i.e. your y, is included in the dataset. So you
need to define two other lists. One containing only the features and one
with the name of the label only. These two lists will tell your
estimator what are the features in the dataset and what column name is
the label

It is done with the code below.


```python
FEATURES = ["crim", "zn", "indus", "nox", "rm",
            "age", "dis", "tax", "ptratio"]
LABEL = "medv"
```

**Step 2:** Convert the data

You need to convert the numeric variables in the proper format.
Tensorflow provides a method to convert continuous variable:
`tf.feature_column.numeric_column()`.

In the previous step, you define a list a feature you want to include in
the model. Now you can use this list to convert them into numeric data.
If you want to exclude features in your model, feel free to drop one or
more variables in the list FEATURES before you construct the
`feature_col`.

Note that you will use Python list comprehension with the list
`FEATURES` to create a new list named `feature_cols`. It helps you
avoid writing nine times `tf.feature_column.numeric_column()`. A list
comprehension is a faster and cleaner way to create new lists


```python
feature_cols = [tf.feature_column.numeric_column(k) for k in FEATURES]
```

**Step 3:** Define the estimator

In this step, you need to define the estimator. Tensorflow currently
provides 6 pre-built estimators, including 3 for classification task and
3 for regression task:

-   Regressor

-   `DNNRegressor`

-   `LinearRegressor`

-   `DNNLineaCombinedRegressor`

-   Classifier

-   `DNNClassifier`

-   `LinearClassifier`

-   `DNNLineaCombinedClassifier`

In this tutorial, you will use the `Linear Regressor`. To access this
function, you need to use `tf.estimator`.

The function needs two arguments:

-   `feature_columns`: Contains the variables to include in the model

-   `model_dir`: path to store the graph, save the model parameters, etc

Tensorflow will automatically create a file named `train` in your
working directory. You need to use this path to access the Tensorboard.


```python
estimator = tf.estimator.LinearRegressor(
    feature_columns=feature_cols,
    model_dir="train")
```

    INFO:tensorflow:Using default config.
    INFO:tensorflow:Using config: {'_model_dir': 'train', '_tf_random_seed': None, '_save_summary_steps': 100, '_save_checkpoints_steps': None, '_save_checkpoints_secs': 600, '_session_config': None, '_keep_checkpoint_max': 5, '_keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours': 10000, '_log_step_count_steps': 100, '_train_distribute': None, '_device_fn': None, '_service': None, '_cluster_spec': <tensorflow.python.training.server_lib.ClusterSpec object at 0x1180f3128>, '_task_type': 'worker', '_task_id': 0, '_global_id_in_cluster': 0, '_master': '', '_evaluation_master': '', '_is_chief': True, '_num_ps_replicas': 0, '_num_worker_replicas': 1}


The tricky part with TensorFlow is the way to feed the model. Tensorflow
is designed to work with parallel computing and very large dataset. Due
to the limitation of the machine resources, it is impossible to feed the
model with all the data at once. For that, you need to feed a batch of
data each time. Note that, we are talking about huge dataset with
millions or more records. If you don’t add batch, you will end up with a
memory error.

For instance, if your data contains 100 observations and you define a
batch size of 10, it means the model will see 10 observations for each
iteration (10\*10).

When the model has seen all the data, it finishes one **epoch**. An
epoch defines how many times you want the model to see the data. It is
better to set this step to `none` and let the model performs iteration
$x$ number of time.

A second information to add is if you want to shuffle the data before
each iteration. During the training, it is important to shuffle the data
so that the model does not learn specific pattern of the dataset. If the
model learns the details of the underlying pattern of the data, it will
have difficulties to generalize the prediction for unseen data. This is
called **overfitting**. The model performs well on the training data but
cannot predict correctly for unseen data.

TensorFlow makes this two steps easy to do. When the data goes to the
pipeline, it knows how many observations it needs (batch) and if it has
to shuffle the data.

To instruct Tensorflow how to feed the model, you can use
`pandas_input_fn`. This object needs 5 parameters:

-   `x`: feature data

-   `y`: label data

-   `batch_size`: batch. By default 128

-   `num_epoch`: Number of epoch, by default 1

-   `shuffle`: Shuffle or not the data. By default, None

You need to feed the model many times so you define a function to repeat
this process. all this function `get_input_fn`.


```python
def get_input_fn(data_set, num_epochs=None, n_batch = 128, shuffle=True):
    return tf.estimator.inputs.pandas_input_fn(
       x=pd.DataFrame({k: data_set[k].values for k in FEATURES}),
       y = pd.Series(data_set[LABEL].values),
       batch_size=n_batch,   
       num_epochs=num_epochs,
       shuffle=shuffle)
```

The usual method to evaluate the performance of a model is to:

-   Train the model

-   Evaluate the model in a different dataset

-   Make prediction

Tensorflow estimator provides three different functions to carry out
this three steps easily.

**Step 4:**: Train the model

You can use the estimator `train` to evaluate the model. The train
estimator needs an `input_fn` and a number of steps. You can use the
function you created above to feed the model. Then, you instruct the
model to iterate 1000 times. Note that, you don’t specify the number of
epochs, you let the model iterates 1000 times. If you set the number of
epoch to 1, then the model will iterate 4 times: There are 400 records
in the training set, and the batch size is 128

1.  128 rows

2.  128 rows

3.  128 rows

4.  16 rows

Therefore, it is easier to set the number of epoch to none and define
the number of iteration.


```python
estimator.train(input_fn=get_input_fn(training_set, 
                                      num_epochs=None,
                                      n_batch = 128,
                                      shuffle=False),
                                      steps=1000)
```

You can check the Tensorboard will the following command:

```
activate hello-tf
# For MacOS
tensorboard --logdir=./train
# For Windows
tensorboard --logdir=train
```

**Step 5:** Evaluate your model

You can evaluate the fit of your model on the test set with the code
below:


```python
ev = estimator.evaluate(
    input_fn=get_input_fn(test_set,
                          num_epochs=1,
                          n_batch = 128,
                          shuffle=False))
```

    INFO:tensorflow:Calling model_fn.
    INFO:tensorflow:Done calling model_fn.
    INFO:tensorflow:Starting evaluation at 2018-08-29-15:49:45
    INFO:tensorflow:Graph was finalized.
    INFO:tensorflow:Restoring parameters from train/model.ckpt-1000
    INFO:tensorflow:Running local_init_op.
    INFO:tensorflow:Done running local_init_op.
    INFO:tensorflow:Finished evaluation at 2018-08-29-15:49:45
    INFO:tensorflow:Saving dict for global step 1000: average_loss = 32.15896, global_step = 1000, label/mean = 22.08, loss = 3215.896, prediction/mean = 22.404533
    INFO:tensorflow:Saving 'checkpoint_path' summary for global step 1000: train/model.ckpt-1000


You can print the loss with the code below:


```python
loss_score = ev["loss"]
print("Loss: {0:f}".format(loss_score))
```

    Loss: 3215.895996


The model has a loss of 3215. You can check the summary statistic to get
an idea of how big the error is.


```python
training_set['medv'].describe()
```




    count    400.000000
    mean      22.625500
    std        9.572593
    min        5.000000
    25%       16.600000
    50%       21.400000
    75%       25.025000
    max       50.000000
    Name: medv, dtype: float64



From the summary statistic above, you know that the average price for a
house is 22 thousand, with a minimum price of 9 thousands and maximum of
50 thousand. The model makes a typical error of 3k dollars.

**Step 6:** Make the prediction

Finally, you can use the estimator `predict` to estimate the value of 6
Boston houses.


```python
y = estimator.predict(
    input_fn=get_input_fn(prediction_set,
                          num_epochs=1,
                          n_batch = 128,
                          shuffle=False))
```

To print the estimated values of $y$, you can use this code:


```python
predictions = list(p["predictions"] for p in itertools.islice(y, 6))
print("Predictions: {}".format(str(predictions)))
```

    INFO:tensorflow:Calling model_fn.
    INFO:tensorflow:Done calling model_fn.
    INFO:tensorflow:Graph was finalized.
    INFO:tensorflow:Restoring parameters from train/model.ckpt-1000
    INFO:tensorflow:Running local_init_op.
    INFO:tensorflow:Done running local_init_op.
    Predictions: [array([32.297546], dtype=float32), array([18.96125], dtype=float32), array([27.270979], dtype=float32), array([29.299236], dtype=float32), array([16.436684], dtype=float32), array([21.460876], dtype=float32)]


The model forecast the following values:

| House | Prediction |      |
| ----- | ---------- | ---- |
| 1     | 32.29      |      |
| 2     | 18.96      |      |
| 3     | 27.27      |      |
| 4     | 29.29      |      |
| 5     | 16.43      |      |
| 7     | 21.46      |      |

Note that we don’t know the true value of $y$. In the tutorial of deep
learning, you will try to beat the linear model

### Numpy Solution


This section explains how to train the model using a numpy estimator to
feed the data. The method is the same exept that you will use
`numpy_input_fn` estimator.


```python
training_set_n = pd.read_csv("/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/Learning/Upwork/tuto_TF/data/boston_train.csv").values
test_set_n = pd.read_csv("/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/Learning/Upwork/tuto_TF/data/boston_test.csv").values
prediction_set_n = pd.read_csv("/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/Learning/Upwork/tuto_TF/data/boston_predict.csv").values
```

**Step 1:** Import the data

First of all, you need to differentiate the feature variables from the
label. You need to do this for the training data and evaluation. It is
faster to define a function to split the data.


```python
def prepare_data(df): 
    X_train = df[:, :-3]
    y_train = df[:,-3]
    return X_train, y_train
```

You can use the function to split the label from the features of the
train/evaluate dataset


```python
X_train, y_train = prepare_data(training_set_n)
X_test, y_test = prepare_data(test_set_n)
```

You need to exclude the last column of the prediction dataset because it
contains only `NaN`


```python
x_predict = prediction_set_n[:, :-2]
```

Confirm the shape of the array. Note that, the label should not have a
dimension, it means `(400,)`.


```python
print(X_train.shape, y_train.shape, x_predict.shape)
```

    (400, 9) (400,) (6, 9)


You can construct the feature columns as follow:


```python
feature_columns = [
      tf.feature_column.numeric_column('x', shape=X_train.shape[1:])]
```

The estimator is defined as before, you instruct the feature columns and
where to save the graph.


```python
estimator = tf.estimator.LinearRegressor(
    feature_columns=feature_columns,
    model_dir="train1")

You can use the numpy estimapor to feed the data to the model and then
train the model. Note that, we define the `input_fn` function before to
ease the readability.


```python
# Train the estimator
train_input = tf.estimator.inputs.numpy_input_fn(
    x={"x": X_train},
    y=y_train,
    batch_size=128,
    shuffle=False,
    num_epochs=None)

estimator.train(input_fn = train_input,steps=5000) 
```

### Tensorflow solution 


The last section is dedicated to a TensorFlow solution. This method is
sligthly more complicated than the other one.

Note that if you use Jupyter notebook, you need to Restart and clean the
kernel to run this session.

TensorFlow has built a great tool to pass the data into the pipeline. In
this section, you will build the `input_fn` function by yourself.

**Step 1:** Define the path and the format of the data

First of all, you declare two variables with the path of the csv file.
Note that, you have two files, one for the training set and one for the
testing set.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
df_train = "/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/Learning/Upwork/tuto_TF/data/boston_train.csv"
df_eval = "/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/Learning/Upwork/tuto_TF/data/boston_test.csv"
```

    /Users/Thomas/anaconda3/envs/hello-tf/lib/python3.6/importlib/_bootstrap.py:219: RuntimeWarning: compiletime version 3.5 of module 'tensorflow.python.framework.fast_tensor_util' does not match runtime version 3.6
      return f(*args, **kwds)


Then, you need to define the columns you want to use from the csv file.
We will use all. After that, you need to declare the type of variable it
is.

Floats variable are defined by `[0.]`


```python
COLUMNS = ["crim", "zn", "indus", "nox", "rm", "age",
           "dis", "tax", "ptratio", "medv"]
RECORDS_ALL = [[0.0], [0.0], [0.0], [0.0],[0.0],[0.0],[0.0],[0.0],[0.0],[0.0]]
```

**Step 2:** Define the `input_fn` function

The function can be broken into three part:

1.  Import the data

2.  Create the iterator

3.  Consume the data

Below is the overal code to define the function. The code will be
explained after


```python
def input_fn(data_file, batch_size, num_epoch = None):
   # Step 1
    def parse_csv(value):
        columns = tf.decode_csv(value, record_defaults= RECORDS_ALL)
        features = dict(zip(COLUMNS, columns))
        #labels = features.pop('median_house_value')
        labels =  features.pop('medv')
        return features, labels
    
      # Extract lines from input files using the Dataset API.
    dataset = (tf.data.TextLineDataset(data_file) # Read text file
       .skip(1) # Skip header row
       .map(parse_csv))
    
    dataset = dataset.repeat(num_epoch)
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size) 
    # Step 3
    iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
    features, labels = iterator.get_next()
    return features, labels
```

**Import the data**

For a csv file, the dataset method reads one line at a time. To build
the dataset, you need to use the object `TextLineDataset.` Your dataset
has a header so you need to use `skip(1)` to skip the first line. At
this point, you only read the data and exclude the header in the
pipeline. To feed the model, you need to separate the features from the
label. The method used to apply any transformation to the data is map.

This method calls a function that you will create in order to instruct
how to transform the data.\
In a nutshell, you need to pass the data in the TextLineDataset object,
exclude the header and apply a transformation which is instructed by a
function.\
Code explanation

-   `tf.data.TextLineDataset(data_file)`: This line read the csv file

-   `.skip(1)` : skip the header

-   `.map(parse_csv))`: parse the records into the tensors
    You need to define a function to instruct the map object. You can
    call this function `parse_csv`.

This function parses the csv file with the method `tf.decode_csv` and
declares the features and the label. The features can be declared as a
dictionary or a tuple. You use the dictionary method because it is more
convenient.
Code explanation

-   `tf.decode_csv(value, record_defaults= RECORDS_ALL)`: the method
    `decode_csv` uses the output of the TextLineDataset to read the csv
    file. `record_defaults instructs` TensorFlow about the columns type.

-   `dict(zip(_CSV_COLUMNS, columns))`: Populate the dictionary with all
    the columns extracted during this data processing

-   `features.pop('median_house_value')`: Exclude the target variable
    from the feature variable and create a label variable

The Dataset needs further elements to iteratively feeds the Tensors.
Indeed, you need to add the method repeat to allow the dataset to
continue indefinitely to feed the model. If you don’t add the method,
the model will iterate only one time and then throw an error because no
more data are fed in the pipeline.

After that, you can control the batch size with the batch method. It
means you tell the dataset how many data you want to pass in the
pipeline for each iteration. If you set a big batch size, the model will
be slow.

**Step 3: Create the iterator**

Now you are ready for the second step: create an iterator to return the
elements in the dataset.

The simplest way of creating an operator is with the method
`make_one_shot_iterator`.

After that, you can create the features and labels from the iterator.

**Step 4: Consume the data**

You can check what happens with `input_fn` function. You need to call
the function in a session to consume the data. You try with a batch size
equals to 1.

Note that, it prints the features in a dictionary and the label as an
array.

It will show the first line of the csv file. You can try to run this
code many times with different batch size.


```python
next_batch = input_fn(df_train, batch_size = 1, num_epoch = None)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    first_batch  = sess.run(next_batch)
    print(first_batch)
```

    ({'crim': array([2.3004], dtype=float32), 'zn': array([0.], dtype=float32), 'indus': array([19.58], dtype=float32), 'nox': array([0.605], dtype=float32), 'rm': array([6.319], dtype=float32), 'age': array([96.1], dtype=float32), 'dis': array([2.1], dtype=float32), 'tax': array([403.], dtype=float32), 'ptratio': array([14.7], dtype=float32)}, array([23.8], dtype=float32))


**Step 4:** Define the feature column

You need to define the numeric columns as follow:


```python
X1= tf.feature_column.numeric_column('crim')
X2= tf.feature_column.numeric_column('zn')
X3= tf.feature_column.numeric_column('indus')
X4= tf.feature_column.numeric_column('nox')
X5= tf.feature_column.numeric_column('rm')
X6= tf.feature_column.numeric_column('age')
X7= tf.feature_column.numeric_column('dis')
X8= tf.feature_column.numeric_column('tax')
X9= tf.feature_column.numeric_column('ptratio')
```

Note that you need to combined all the variables in a *bucket*


```python
base_columns = [X1, X2, X3,X4, X5, X6,X7, X8, X9]
```

**Step 5:** Build the model

You can train the model with the estimator `LinearRegressor`.


```python
model = tf.estimator.LinearRegressor(feature_columns=base_columns,
                                         model_dir='train3')
```

You need to use a `lambda` function to allow to write the argument in
the function `inpu_fn`. If you don’t use a `lambda` function, you cannot
train the model.


```python

model.train(steps =1000,
    input_fn=lambda : input_fn(df_train,batch_size=128, num_epoch = None))

       global_step, was: 1000


The last step is predicting the value of $y$ based on the value of $X$,
the matrices of the features. You can write a dictionary with the values
you want to predict. Your model has 9 features so you need to provide a
value for each. The model will provide a prediction for each of them.

In the code below, you wrote the values of each features that is
contained in the `df_predict` csv file.

You need to write a new `input_fn` function because there is no label in
the dataset. You can use the API `from_tensor` from the `Dataset`.


```python
prediction_input = {
    'crim': [0.03359,5.09017,0.12650,0.05515,8.15174,0.24522],
    'zn': [75.0,0.0,25.0,33.0,0.0,0.0],
    'indus': [2.95,18.10,5.13,2.18,18.10,9.90],
    'nox': [0.428,0.713,0.453,0.472,0.700,0.544],
    'rm': [7.024,6.297,6.762,7.236,5.390,5.782],
    'age': [15.8,91.8,43.4,41.1,98.9,71.7],
    'dis': [5.4011,2.3682,7.9809,4.0220,1.7281,4.0317],
    'tax': [252,666,284,222,666,304],
    'ptratio': [18.3,20.2,19.7,18.4,20.2,18.4]
}

def test_input_fn():
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors(prediction_input)
    return dataset

# Predict all our prediction_input
pred_results = model.predict(input_fn=test_input_fn)
```

Finaly, you print the predictions.


```python
for pred in enumerate(pred_results):
    print(pred)
```

## Summary

To train a model, you need to:

-   Define the features: Independent variables: X

-   Define the label: Dependent variable: y

-   Construct a train/test set

-   Define the initial weight

-   Define the loss function: MSE

-   Optimize the model: Gradient descent

-   Define:

-   Learning rate

-   Number of epoch

-   Batch size

In this tutorial, you learned how to use the high level API for a linear
regression estimator. You need to define:

1.  Feature columns. If continuous:
    `tf.feature_column.numeric_column()`. You can populate a list with
    python list comprehension
2.  The estimator: `tf.estimator.LinearRegressor(feature_columns,model_dir)`
3.  A function to import the data, the batch size and epoch: `input_fn()`

After that, you are ready to train, evaluate and make prediction with
`train()`, `evaluate()` and `predict()`
