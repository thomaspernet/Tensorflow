    "\n",
    "The two most common supervised learning tasks are linear regression and\n",
    "linear classifier. Linear regression predicts a value while the linear\n",
    "classifier predicts a class. This tutorial is focused on Linear\n",
    "Classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification problems represent roughly 80 percent of the machine\n",
    "learning task. Classification aims at predicting the probability of each\n",
    "class given a set of inputs. The label (i.e., the dependent variable) is\n",
    "a discrete value, called a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If the label has only two classes, the learning algorithm is a\n",
    "    binary classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Multiclass classifier tackles labels with more than two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a typical binary classification problem is to predict the\n",
    "likelihood a customer makes a second purchase. Predict the type of\n",
    "animal displayed on a picture is multiclass classification problem since\n",
    "there are more than two varieties of animal existing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical part of this tutorial puts primary focus on the binary\n",
    "class. You will learn more about the multiclass output function in a\n",
    "future tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Binary classifier works?\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned in the previous tutorial that a function is composed of two\n",
    "kind of variables, a dependent variable and a set of features\n",
    "(independent variables). In the linear regression, a dependent variable\n",
    "is a real number without range. The primary objective is to predict its\n",
    "value by minimizing the mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a binary task, the label can have had two possible integer values.\n",
    "In most case, it is either `[0,1]` or `[1,2]`. For instance, the\n",
    "objective is to predict whether a customer will buy a product or not.\n",
    "The label is defined as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Y = 1` (customer purchased the product)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Y = 0` (customer does not purchase the product)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses the features `X` to classify each customer in the most\n",
    "likely class he belongs to, namely, potential buyer or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of success is computed with **logistic regression**. The\n",
    "algorithm will compute a probability based on the feature `X` and\n",
    "predicts a success when this probability is above 50 percent. More\n",
    "formally, the probability is calculated as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Y = 1|x) = \\frac{1}{1 + exp( - (\\theta^{T}x + b))}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is the set of weights, $x$ the features and b the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function can be decomposed into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The linear model\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The logistic function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear model**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are already familiar with the way the weights are computed. Weights\n",
    "are computed using a dot product: $\\theta^{T}x + b$ that is $\\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i w_i +b$. `Y` is a linear function of all the\n",
    "features $x_i$. If the model does not have features, the prediction is\n",
    "equal to the bias, $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights indicate the direction of the correlation between the\n",
    "features $x_i$ and the label $Y$. A positive correlation increases the\n",
    "probability of the positive class while a negative correlation leads the\n",
    "probability closer to 0, (i.e., negative class).\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear model returns only real number, which is inconsistent with\n",
    "the probability measure of range `[0,1]`. The logistic function is\n",
    "required to convert the linear model output to a probability,\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic function, or sigmoid function, has an S-shape and the\n",
    "output of this function is always between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{1 + exp( - t)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/thomaspernet/Tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/17_logit_v4_files/image011.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to substitute the output of the linear regression into the\n",
    "sigmoid function. It results in a new number with a probability between\n",
    "0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier can transform the probability into a class\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Values between 0 to 0.49 become class 0\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Values between 0.5 to 1 become class 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Measure the performance of Linear Classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall performance of a classifier is measured with the accuracy\n",
    "metric. Accuracy collects all the correct values divided by the total\n",
    "number of observations. For instance, an accuracy value of 80 percent\n",
    "means the model is correct in 80 percent of the cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/thomaspernet/Tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/17_logit_v4_files/image013.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can note a shortcoming with this metric, especially for imbalance\n",
    "class. An imbalance dataset occurs when the number of observations per\n",
    "group is not equal. Let’s say; you try to classify a rare event with a\n",
    "logistic function. Imagine the classifier tries to estimate the death of\n",
    "a patient following a disease. In the data, 5 percent of the patients\n",
    "pass away. You can train a classifier to predict the number of death and\n",
    "use the accuracy metric to evaluate the performances. If the classifier\n",
    "predicts 0 death for the entire dataset, it will be correct in 95\n",
    "percent of the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confusion matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way to assess the performance of a classifier is to look at the\n",
    "confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/thomaspernet/Tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/17_logit_v4_files/image015.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix visualizes the accuracy of a classifier by\n",
    "comparing the actual and predicted classes. The binary confusion matrix\n",
    "is composed of squares:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   TP: True Positive: Predicted values correctly predicted as actual\n",
    "    positive\n",
    "\n",
    "-   FP: Predicted values incorrectly predicted an actual positive. i.e.,\n",
    "    Negative values predicted as positive\n",
    "\n",
    "-   FN: False Negative: Positive values predicted as negative\n",
    "\n",
    "-   TN: True Negative: Predicted values correctly predicted as actual\n",
    "    negative\n",
    "\n",
    "From the confusion matrix, it is easy to compare the actual class and\n",
    "predicted class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Precision and Sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix provides a good insight into the true positive and\n",
    "false positive. In some case, it is preferable to have a more concise\n",
    "metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision**\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision metric shows the accuracy of the positive class. It\n",
    "measures how likely the prediction of the positive class is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Precision = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{TP + FP}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum score is 1 when the classifier perfectly classifies all the\n",
    "positive values. Precision alone is not very helpful because it ignores\n",
    "the negative class. The metric is usually paired with Recall metric.\n",
    "Recall is also called sensitivity or true positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sensitivity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity computes the ratio of positive classes correctly detected.\n",
    "This metric gives how good the model is to recognize a positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Recall = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{TP + FN}$$\n",
